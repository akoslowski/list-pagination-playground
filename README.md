`Pager.app` implements a na√Øve way of a paginated list. The user is supposed to infinitely 
scroll through a list, interupted by loading the next page when the user approaches the end 
of the loaded items.

## Setup

The app works without a network connection. The data is created locally, the interface would 
allow fetching the data from a remote source though.
